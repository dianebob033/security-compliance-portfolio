# AWS Shared Responsibility Model Summary (Portfolio)

## AWS Responsibilities (Security "of" the Cloud)
- Physical security, infrastructure, hypervisor, etc.

## Customer Responsibilities (Security "in" the Cloud)
- IAM configuration (users/roles/policies)
- Data classification and encryption
- Logging, monitoring, retention
- Network controls (security groups/NACLs)
- Incident response readiness

## Practical Implications
- Control owners (AWS vs Customer)
- Evidence sources (CloudTrail, IAM configs, KMS settings)
