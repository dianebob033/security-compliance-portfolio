## What I’d do in week 1 (on the job)
1. Validate scope, data classification, and control owners with stakeholders.
2. Baseline current state vs. the controls checklist; identify top 5 gaps.
3. Create an evidence collection plan and cadence (who/what/when).
4. Produce a prioritized remediation plan with owners and due dates.
5. Set up a lightweight reporting rhythm (weekly status + risk updates).
